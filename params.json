{"name":"Avgrund Maintenance","tagline":"VqMod For OpenCart","body":"### Welcome to Avgrund Maintenance Plugin Documentation.\r\nThis VqMod is the easiest way to add a little extra to your maintenance screen. We all hate to see this screen, as it means lost time selling, but its a fact of life that regular backup saves us in the event of a server meltdown.:\r\n\r\nThe base maintenance screen is a little generic and boring for today's graphical and effect driven web. Why spend money on a beautiful site and then show a plain boring maintenance message and screen to your users. These are potential sales that you are missing out on. So how to fix this?\r\n\r\n### Use the Avgrund Modal Plugin.\r\nThis plugin has been integrated into a VqMod with an administration module (which means you can control the details without having to code). All you need is a current version of VqMod which you can find [here](http://#)\r\n\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
